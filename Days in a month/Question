Write a Java program that takes as input a month (1-12) and a year and then calculates and prints the number of days in that month for the given year, taking into account leap years. If the input is invalid (e.g., a month outside the range 1-12 or a negative year), the program should output 'Invalid input'. Optimize the code for readability and maintainability by using methods and arrays for managing month names and days in each month.
